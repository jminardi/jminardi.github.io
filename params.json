{"name":"Jack Minardi","tagline":"software + hardware = ","body":"### Hi, I'm Jack.\r\nI am an electrical engineer by training, and a software developer by craft.\r\n\r\nMy goal is to make it simple for scientists to play with their data. I accomplish this with intuitive UIs and powerful data processing. In my free time I like to explore and develop ideas in the world of human computer interfaces.\r\n\r\nI recently led the winning team at the [YCombinator Hardware Hackathon](http://techcrunch.com/2013/02/26/y-combinator-hardware-hackathon-winner/), where we designed and prototyped a novel form of human-computer interaction. I like Raspberry Pis and Python, so check out some of my [projects](https://github.com/jminardi/RobotBrain) [involving](https://github.com/jminardi/pycon-demo) [both](https://github.com/jminardi/RobotBrain-Controller).\r\n\r\nI am currently working on a book involving Raspberry Pis, home automation, mobile software, and possibly powerful lasers.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
