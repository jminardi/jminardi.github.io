Hi, I'm [Jack](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fMJCFs8jrgIQ2FnjcwwQfM3wl6l0IoYgeoey6rkKRMI/edit?usp=sharing).
==============

I put my codes on [github](http://www.github.com/jminardi) and my tweets on
[twitter](http://www.twitter.com/jackminardi).

I am an electrical engineer by training, and a software developer by craft. I
went to school at [Vanderbilt University in Nashville
TN](http://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/). I am currently employed at [Harvard
University's Lewis Lab](http://lewisgroup.seas.harvard.edu/) developing next
generation 3D printers and the software that drives them.

My goal is to make it simple for scientists to play with their data and create
new objects. I accomplish this with intuitive UIs on top of powerful machines.
In my free time I like to explore and develop ideas in the world of human
computer interfaces.

I recently led the winning team at the [YCombinator Hardware
Hackathon](/raspberry_pi/ycombinator-hardware-hackathon/),
where we designed and prototyped a novel form of human-computer interaction.
You can see me demo the design in my [TechCrunch
interview](http://techcrunch.com/2013/02/26/y-combinator-hardware-hackathon-winner/).
[Here](https://gist.github.com/jminardi/5022297) is the script that powered the
demo.
