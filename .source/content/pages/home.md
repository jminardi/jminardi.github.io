Hi, I'm [Jack](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fMJCFs8jrgIQ2FnjcwwQfM3wl6l0IoYgeoey6rkKRMI/edit?usp=sharing).
==============

I put my codes on [github](http://www.github.com/jminardi) and my tweets on
[twitter](http://www.twitter.com/jackminardi).

I am an electrical engineer by training, and a software developer by craft. I
went to school at [Vanderbilt University in Nashville
TN](http://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/). I am currently employed at [Harvard
University's Lewis Lab](http://lewisgroup.seas.harvard.edu/) developing new 3D
printers and the software that drives them. The 3D printers use next generation
materials to produce electronics and flexible sensors for robotics and medial
applications.

I enjoy expanding the human-computer interface. I led a team at the [2013
YCombinator Hardware Hackathon][0] where we did just that. My team took first
prize for developing a novel haptic feedback glove, which you can see in my
[TechCrunch interview][1].

I've been known to enjoy programming my [raspberry pi][3] to
interface with the real world. Check out my [projects][2] page to see
some of the things I've been up to recently.
