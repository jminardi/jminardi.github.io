## Tactilous: A Force-Feeback Haptic Glove

This glove was my winning entry in the YCombinator Hardware Hackathon. I led a
team of six engineers in designing and prototyping a novel form of
human-computer interaction.

I built a small car that is steered wirelessly through an Android phone. This
project served as an introduction to Raspberry Pi hardware control and Android
programming.

## RobotBrain: An Open Source Python Framework for Sensor and Actuator Control
![](|filename|/images/project-banners/robot-brain.png)

RobotBrain is an open source library I've developed to simplify hardware
interactions with the Raspberry Pi. I've written easy to use interfaces on top
of many useful sensors and actuators.

## Haptic Band: An Ever Present Sense of Direction Though Vibration
![](|filename|/images/project-banners/ankle-compass.png)

For my final project in my embedded systems course at Vanderbilt I designed and
implemented a prototype device that when worn gives the wearer an ever-present
sense of direction. The belt wraps around your ankle and uses one of eight
embedded vibration motors to indicate direction.

## DeathRay: Open Source Application for Control and Visualization of Lab Equipment
![](|filename|/images/project-banners/deathray.png)

For my senior engineering project at Vanderbilt I led a team of 3 students in
designing, architecting, and implementing a GUI application to control lab
equipment. The application is written in Python and uses the GPIB protocol
to speak to connected devices.
