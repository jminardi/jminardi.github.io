The Raspberry Pi is a cheap, credit-card sized computer. It runs a full linux
operating system, so you can program in most any language that feels
comfortable to you.

The Pi was built as a teaching tool, intended to get young people into programming
by giving them a device that could truly be theirs. You can find more about
the philosophy of the Raspberry Pi on the [Raspberry Pi Foundation's Website](
http://www.raspberrypi.org/about)

But what I think makes the Raspberry Pi special is its ability to interact with
the real world. The Pi comes built with GPIO pins, which allow you to
programmatically control exterior devices like a servo motor or an LED. Check
out my page on [Raspberry Pi Hardware Control](
raspberry_pi/opendevreal_world/) to find more examples of this.
