    <h2>Notes Everywhere</h2>
<p><img alt="Messy Desk" src="../../images/messy-desk.png" />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jazzmasterson/278672002/">source</a></p>
<p>I like to take long running notes, jotting down an idea here and there when
one pops up. I never know which devices I will have with me, so I like to have
these notes synced across all of them.</p>
<p>Previously I had been using the Chrome plugin
<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/quick-note/mijlebbfndhelmdpmllgcfadlkankhok?hl=en-US">QuickNote</a>
which is a light weight interface on top of the <a href="http://www.diigo.com">diigo</a>
cloud service. I had been using it for about two years and never had a problem
until a few days ago. I somehow managed to lose about three months of edits. I
still have not quite shaken that feeling of despair knowing I will never get my
data back, but it did finally force me to beef up my note-syncing system.
While I will primarily be using this setup to sync notes, it is by no means
limited to only text files.</p>
<h2>Enter BitTorrent Sync</h2>
<p><a href="http://labs.bittorrent.com/experiments/sync.html">BitTorrent Sync</a> is a free
utility that uses the bittorrent protocol to keep folders in sync across
devices. It can be used with OS X, Windows, Android and Linux. It is not
however open source, which might be a deal breaker for some.  But if this 
isn't too big a pill for you to swallow, with a little bit of work you can use
btsync as a free syncing solution.</p>
<p>While Dropbox requires you to keep a copy of your data on their servers, 
btsync never requires your data to inhabit a device you do not own.
This is nice for security, but it means to sync between two devices they both
need to be online at the same time. That is where the Raspberry Pi comes in.
You can use the Pi as a node in your sync network, so a change to a file on any
device will sync with the Pi and then other devices will get the change when
they come online.</p>
<p>First we will set up the Pi as the central server and then we will connect our
devices to it. (It is important to note however that the Pi is not a special
"server" node, it is just a regular node like any other device.)</p>
<h2>Installing BitTorrent Sync on the Raspberry Pi</h2>
<p>NOTE: I am using Raspbian Wheezy, but I suspect these ideas will translate to
other operating systems.</p>
<p>You need to grab the <a href="http://btsync.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/btsync_arm.tar.gz">ARM
build</a> of
BitTorrent Sync:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>mkdir ~/.btsync <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="nb">cd</span> ~/.btsync
wget http://btsync.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/btsync_arm.tar.gz
tar -xvf btsync_arm.tar.gz
</pre></div>


<p>Unless you have a large SD in your Pi you will probably want to use an external
drive for your sync location. I will be using a USB thumb drive. You may need
to format your thumb drive as EXT4 if you are having issues. (<em>WARNING! This
will erase all data on your drive</em>)</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>df -h                               <span class="c"># find your drive here, e.g. `sda1`</span>
sudo umount /dev/sda1               <span class="c"># replace sda1 with your drive name !</span>
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda1 -L BTSync  <span class="c"># replace sda1 with your drive name !</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Now all you have to do is launch the btsync application and you will be up and
running!</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nb">cd</span> ~/.btsync
sudo ./btsync  <span class="c"># can be killed with `sudo killall btsync`</span>
</pre></div>


<p>If you see the following output btsync is properly running.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>BitTorrent Sync forked to background. <span class="nv">pid</span> <span class="o">=</span> 3003
</pre></div>


<p>Navigate your browser to <code>Your-Pi-IP-Address:8888/gui</code> to manage the btsync
process. To add the thumb drive select "Add Folder" and navigate to
<code>/media/BTSync</code>. You will need to generate a secret as this is the first time
you are adding the folder.</p>
<p><img src='/images/btsync-web-interface.png' id='borderless'></p>
<p><img alt="Add Folfer" src="../../images/add-folder.png" /></p>
<h2>Other Devices</h2>
<p>Now go download the
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bittorrent.sync">Android app</a>
and/or the <a href="http://labs.bittorrent.com/experiments/sync.html">desktop app</a> and
connect them using the secret you just generated It's that simple! Any change
on any device will be synced across all online devices. If you keep your Pi
online it will store and push the most up to date content as your other devices
go on and off line.</p>
<h2>Extra Credit</h2>
<h3>Start at Boot</h3>
<p>You may want to set btsync to start when you boot your Raspberry Pi. To do that
we will place a script in <code>/etc/init.d/</code> and then register it with
<code>update-rc.d</code>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>sudo nano /etc/init.d/btsync
</pre></div>


<p>Paste the following code in the script</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c">#! /bin/sh</span>
<span class="c"># /etc/init.d/btsync</span>
<span class="c">#</span>

<span class="c"># Carry out specific functions when asked to by the system</span>
<span class="k">case</span> <span class="s2">&quot;$1&quot;</span> in
start<span class="o">)</span>
    /home/pi/.btsync/btsync
    ;;
stop<span class="o">)</span>
    killall btsync
    ;;
*<span class="o">)</span>
    <span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Usage: /etc/init.d/btsync {start|stop}&quot;</span>
    <span class="nb">exit </span>1
    ;;
<span class="k">esac</span>

<span class="nb">exit </span>0
</pre></div>


<p>Then change the permissions, test, and register it to run at boot:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>sudo chmod 755 /etc/init.d/btsync
sudo /etc/init.d/btsync start       <span class="c"># test that the script starts</span>
sudo /etc/init.d/btsync stop        <span class="c"># test that the script stops</span>
sudo update-rc.d btsync defaults
</pre></div>


<h3>Password Protect Web Interface</h3>
<p>If you expose your web interface to the outside world (or if you don't trust
your friends) you are going to want to password protect it.  This can be done
with a btsync config file passed to the executable at runtime with the
<code>--config</code> flag. First, use btsync to generate a sample config file, modify it
to fit your needs, and restart the process.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nb">cd</span> ~/.btsync
./btsync --dump-sample-config &gt; btsync.conf
<span class="c"># browse the sample config file and change what you want</span>
sudo killall btsync
sudo ./btsync --config btsync.conf
</pre></div>


<p>HINT: Use <a href="http://jsonlint.com/">jsonlint</a> to validate your config file if
btsync complains. Also make sure to modify the <code>/etc/init.d/btsync</code> script to
use the config file as well.</p>
